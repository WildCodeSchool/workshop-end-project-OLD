# End of project 

This workshop will last 3 days.

## DAY 1 morning : last User Stories
- The group sends their **last** feature Pull Request. No more US will be accept after this moment.

## DAY 1 afternoon : test 
- Each group installs the project of another group (think to write a good REAME.md on your project to help other developers install and configure your project).

- Once the project you have to test is ready, check :
    - Every feature, every link works well
    - Graphic consistency
    - UX
    - Responsive design
    - Check main pages with W3C validator
    - Try every form and challenge security
    - Spelling mistakes
    - etc...
- For EVERY problem, open an issue on the project repository
    1. Go to "Issue" tab of tested project
    2. Create a new issue, with a clear name and concise explanation of how reproduce the bug
    3. add a "fix" label
    
## DAY 2 : Fix, fix, fix
Each group works on its own project
- Read all the fix issues 
- Clean the issues (merge, delete if necessary). Pay attention to eliminate issues which are evolutions (new features) and not real bugs. Only focus and bugs to fix
- Prioritize the remaining issues
- Assign the issues as tasks to each member of the team, and add them to your sprint planning

> HINT : you can automatically close current issues when you add the issue id to your commit message, e.g. "fix form validation, issue #12" will close the issue.

**Last Pull Requests will be accepted at the end of Day 2, no more PR will we accepted on DAY 3. You are warned!**

## DAY 3 : Demo DAY training 
The team will prepare their presentation and rehearse, again and again, to be ready for the Demo at the end of the day. 
- 5 min max per project (everyone can speak ~1-2 min)
- if necessary, you can create some slides to quickly introduce the project 
- rehearse, rehearse, rehearse
- choose somebody to share its screen with a clean project (clean the database, the uplaoded images...)
You will have to rehearse in front of your trainer(s).

Just before the Demo Day, a global rehearsal will be done with all groups.
